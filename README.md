# Create-own-NFT-using-Moralis
In the above attached files-index.html we have interaction buttons to interact with metamask.It also has NFT id.We can uplaod and mint it using that button.
In logic file-it has the logic of how to create an NFT.It shows how to link token with metadata.It has ipfs which has decentralised behaviour.From image object we are creating new moralis file.
From moralis we are going to hash of the file and url who has ipfs gateway.
Install requirements file in your desired folder.
Use python -m flask run command to run the program
So moralis has new version now which doesnot have server and server url like previous version.
I followed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2qTyc-V9cM - to create a server in moralis and got the server url from that.
I am going to attach the folder which I used for server creation.
Following all these steps you can connect it with metamask and create NFT.
